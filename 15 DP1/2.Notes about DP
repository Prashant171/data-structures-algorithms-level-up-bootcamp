A Note about DP

DP is a optimisation technique
For problems with 
1. optimal substructure           (If the solutions can be built by the result of sub problems)  
2. overlapping sub-problems

Dp solutions can be
    - Top Down (Recursion + memoisation)
    - Bottom Up (Iterative)

Bottom up approach is efficient than top Down
But writing top down dp is easy
